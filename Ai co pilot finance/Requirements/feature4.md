# Feature 4: Dynamic Cashflow Forecasting & Scenario Modeling  

This feature provides micro-business owners with forward-looking financial visibility. It allows them to anticipate cash shortages, evaluate potential operational decisions, and plan proactively.

The objective is not generic forecasting.  
The objective is actionable, scenario-driven liquidity awareness.

This feature transforms historical and real-time data into predictive insights that support operational control.

## 4.1 Epic – Predictive Cashflow Engine  

This epic calculates future cash positions based on historical patterns, scheduled transactions, and outstanding receivables/payables.

---

### 4.1.1 Story – Historical Trend Analysis  

The system shall analyze past financial transactions to:

- Identify recurring cash inflows and outflows  
- Detect seasonal trends  
- Highlight average payment and collection periods  
- Calculate volatility and variability in cash movement  

**Functional Requirements:**

- AI-assisted pattern recognition  
- Configurable historical timeframe  
- Integration with customer and supplier behavior profiles  

The goal is to create a baseline model for predictive cashflow without requiring manual calculations.

---

### 4.1.2 Story – Scheduled Cashflow Integration  

The system shall incorporate all scheduled transactions, including:

- Pending invoices  
- Recurring expenses  
- Salary and tax obligations  
- Loan or financing payments  

The engine shall:

- Adjust projected balances in real-time  
- Display cumulative net cash position over defined periods  
- Provide color-coded alerts for potential shortfalls  

This ensures the forecast reflects operational reality, not just historical trends.

### 4.1.3 Story – Probabilistic Cashflow Projection  

The system shall generate probabilistic forecasts by:

- Weighting expected receivables by customer reliability  
- Accounting for potential delays in payments  
- Incorporating expense variability and anomalies  

The output shall include:

- Best-case, worst-case, and expected scenarios  
- Confidence intervals for liquidity availability  
- Clear visual representations  

This enables data-driven contingency planning.

## 4.2 Epic – Scenario Simulation & “What-If” Analysis  

This epic allows users to simulate alternative operational decisions and visualize their impact on cashflow.

---

### 4.2.1 Story – Operational Scenario Modeling  

The system shall allow the user to simulate:

- Delayed supplier payments  
- Early invoice collection  
- Adjusted salary disbursements  
- One-time operational expenses or revenue events  

Each scenario shall show:

- Impact on cash position  
- Effect on liquidity thresholds  
- Predicted risks or deficits  

This empowers the owner to plan proactively.

---

### 4.2.2 Story – Revenue Adjustment Simulation  

The platform shall allow users to adjust projected revenue inputs:

- Customer payment acceleration or delays  
- Cancellation or addition of contracts  
- Fluctuations in recurring service revenue  

The system recalculates projected liquidity and alerts the user to potential stress points.

---

### 4.2.3 Story – Expense Optimization Simulation  

The system shall let users test:

- Deferring discretionary expenses  
- Adjusting recurring supplier payments  
- Temporary cost-cutting measures  

The simulation shall integrate with the cashflow engine and:

- Display updated short-term and long-term liquidity  
- Highlight operational sustainability thresholds  
- Enable scenario comparison with historical trends

## 4.3 Epic – Forecast Visualization & Actionable Reporting  

This epic ensures that predictive and scenario data is presented clearly for decision-making.

---

### 4.3.1 Story – Interactive Cashflow Timeline  

The system shall provide a visual, time-based projection of cash inflows and outflows, showing:

- Net daily/weekly/monthly positions  
- Highlighted high-risk periods  
- Layered best-case and worst-case scenarios  

The interface must prioritize clarity and simplicity.

---

### 4.3.2 Story – Forecast Dashboard & Alerts  

The system shall present:

- Key forecast metrics (projected balance, buffer ratio, deficit probability)  
- Notifications for potential liquidity issues  
- Drill-down capability to view underlying transactions  

This allows proactive operational decisions before issues arise.

---

### 4.3.3 Story – Export & Sharing Functionality  

The platform shall allow the user to:

- Export forecast data to PDF/Excel  
- Share scenarios with partners or accountants  
- Archive historical forecast comparisons  

This ensures documentation and accountability without requiring additional software.
